    This visualization shows the relationship between horsepower and fuel economy (MPG) across a wide range of vehicles. While horsepower and MPG are generally considered to have an inverse relationship, the actual data reveals a more complex interaction influenced by factors such as fuel type, manufacturer, and vehicle size. 
    conventional gasoline vehicles show a partial trend where higher horsepower often correlates with lower fuel economy, although this is not universally the case.
    Hybrids and plug-in hybrids are known for their fuel efficiency and tend to have a more balanced distribution of horsepower.
    Electric Vehicles (EVs) tend to maintain high MPG ratings while offering a wide range of horsepower values.
    This visualization provides an overview of the overall distribution and key trends in the data. In the following scenes, we will explore more detailed analyses by vehicle type or brand.
