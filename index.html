    <h2>Scene 1: Horsepower vs. MPG: The Overview</h2>
    <p>Explore the overall trend: higher horsepower leads to lower MPG?</p>

    In this scene, a scatterplot is constructed in order to show the relationship between horsepower and fuel economy (MPG and MPGe) from 2024 data. It is over the domain of all cars. The columns hpv, comb08, combE are used for horsepower and fuel economy, respectively. combE values are given to electric vehicles in order to be put on the same scale as other vehicles. This value is a measure of how many miles per gallon of gasoline would have the same energy content as a certain amount of electric charge consumed by an electric vehicle (EV). MPGe (Miles Per Gallon Equivalent) was created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assist consumers in comparing the energy consumption of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with that of gasoline-powered vehicles. Because electric vehicles do not use gasoline, the MPGe rating is a conversion of the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity the vehicle consumes and can be thought of as the number of miles that a vehicle can be driven using the energy equivalent to a gallon of gasoline. While horsepower and fuel economy are generally expected to have an inverse relationship where high horsepower tends to reduce fuel efficiency,the scatterplot below shows a more nuanced interaction shaped by additional factors such as fuel type, manufacturer, and vehicle type.
    <br>Generally, horsepower and MPG typically have an inverse relationship. Conventional gasoline-powered vehicles like the Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro often demonstrate this expected trend: higher horsepower , lower fuel economy. However, this pattern is not absolute. Some models with optimized engines, such as the Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, manage to strike a reasonable balance between performance and efficiency, especially in their lower trims.
    <br>Hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, including the Toyota Prius, Hyundai Ioniq, and Ford Escape Hybrid, are engineered for fuel efficiency and tend to cluster in regions of the graph that represent moderate horsepower with high MPG. These vehicles illustrate how advancements in hybrid technology allow for respectable performance without compromising efficiency.
    <br>Electric vehicles (EVs), such as the Tesla Model 3, Chevrolet Bolt, and Nissan Leaf, break traditional patterns altogether. Despite having high horsepower, especially in performance versions like the Tesla Model S Plaid, they exhibit outstanding fuel efficiency, often exceeding 100 MPGe. They span a wide range of horsepower values but consistently maintain high MPG values, underscoring the impact of electric drivetrains on fuel efficiency.
    <br>Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), such as the Hyundai Nexo, also stand out in the plot. Powered by hydrogen, FCVs only emit water vapor and offer high fuel economy (often greater than 55 MPGe) at the cost of moderate horsepower.
