    <h2>Scene 1: Horsepower vs. Fuel Efficiency: The Overview</h2>
    <p>Explore the overall trend: higher horsepower leads to lower MPG?</p>

    In this scene, a scatterplot is constructed in order to show the relationship between horsepower and fuel economy (MPG and MPGe) from 2024 data. It is over the domain of all cars. The columns hpv, comb08, combE are used for horsepower and fuel economy, respectively. combE values are given to electric vehicles in order to be put on the same scale as other vehicles. This value is a measure of how many miles per gallon of gasoline would have the same energy content as a certain amount of electric charge consumed by an electric vehicle (EV). MPGe (Miles Per Gallon Equivalent) was created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assist consumers in comparing the energy consumption of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with that of gasoline-powered vehicles. Because electric vehicles do not use gasoline, the MPGe rating is a conversion of the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity the vehicle consumes and can be thought of as the number of miles that a vehicle can be driven using the energy equivalent to a gallon of gasoline. While horsepower and fuel economy are generally expected to have an inverse relationship where high horsepower tends to reduce fuel efficiency,the scatterplot below shows a more nuanced interaction shaped by additional factors such as fuel type, manufacturer, and vehicle type.
    <br>Generally, horsepower and MPG typically have an inverse relationship. Conventional gasoline-powered vehicles like the Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro often demonstrate this expected trend: higher horsepower , lower fuel economy. However, this pattern is not absolute. Some models with optimized engines, such as the Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, manage to strike a reasonable balance between performance and efficiency, especially in their lower trims.
    <br>Hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, including the Toyota Prius, Hyundai Ioniq, and Ford Escape Hybrid, are engineered for fuel efficiency and tend to cluster in regions of the graph that represent moderate horsepower with high MPG. These vehicles illustrate how advancements in hybrid technology allow for respectable performance without compromising efficiency.
    <br>Electric vehicles (EVs), such as the Tesla Model 3, Chevrolet Bolt, and Nissan Leaf, break traditional patterns altogether. Despite having high horsepower, especially in performance versions like the Tesla Model S Plaid, they exhibit outstanding fuel efficiency, often exceeding 100 MPGe. They span a wide range of horsepower values but consistently maintain high MPG values, underscoring the impact of electric drivetrains on fuel efficiency.
    <br>Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), such as the Hyundai Nexo, also stand out in the plot. Powered by hydrogen, FCVs only emit water vapor and offer high fuel economy (often greater than 55 MPGe) at the cost of moderate horsepower.

    <h2>Scene 2: Fuel Efficiency and Savings: How Much Can You Save?</h2>
    <p>Discover how fuel efficiency translates into long-term cost savings.</p>
    <div id="scene2-vis"></div>
  <div id="scene2-narration" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 40px; font-size: 20px; max-width: 1150px;"text-indent: 20px;">
    In this scene, we explore how fuel efficiency directly affects long-term cost savings across various types of vehicles: gasoline, hybrid, electric, and FCV. Here used values of comb08, combE, and youSaveSpend (5-Year Fuel Savings) to provide clear insight into economic efficiency. youSaveSpend tells you how much more or less money you will spend on fuel over five years compared to an average new car. A positive value means the vehicle is expected to save money on fuel over five years. With rising fuel prices and growing consumer interest in sustainability, the financial implications of fuel efficiency are more relevant than ever.
    <br>Performance-oriented gasoline vehicles like the Ford Mustang Fastback, with a combined fuel economy near 22 MPG, tend to incur significantly higher fuel costs over time. Its 5-Year Fuel Savings value is approximately –$6,000, indicating that owners can expect to spend $6,000 more on fuel over five years compared to the average new vehicle. This substantial cost difference reflects the Mustang’s powerful engine and sporty design, which prioritize performance over fuel efficiency.
    In contrast, more fuel-efficient gasoline models such as the Toyota Corolla, achieving around 35 MPG, offer a markedly different economic profile. With a 5-Year Fuel Savings of about +$1,000, Corolla drivers can save money on fuel costs relative to the average vehicle, benefiting from its focus on efficiency and practicality.
    This is a good example of the difference in running costs within a certain fuel group. Design factors, from high performance to fuel economy play a crucial role in shaping long-term ownership costs. Understanding these trade-offs is a must when choosing a vehicle.
    <br>Hybrids offer more balance of power and fuel efficiency. Take the Toyota Corolla Hybrid, which typically delivers over 52 MPG. According to EPA data, its 5-Year Fuel Savings is around +$4,000, meaning the owner is expected to save $4,000 in fuel costs over five years compared to the average new vehicle. Similarly, the Honda Accord Hybrid achieves about 48 MPG and offers a 5-Year Fuel Savings of +$3,000, while the Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid leads the class with around 58 MPG and a savings of nearly +$5,000 over five years. Over time, hybrids bridge the gap between affordability and sustainability, making them a smart choice for everyday drivers.
